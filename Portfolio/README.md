Hello! This is my in progress Data Engineering portfolio. Most of the projects are being done as part of my self development, covering essentials skills used in the Data Engineering area.

### [Pulling Data From A JSON RESTful API - Get Daily CVEs](https://github.com/bbjrgithub/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Portfolio/Get_Daily_CVEs)

- Overview: For my first Data Engineering project I decided to be contrarian and use Golang instead of the commonly used Python to extract the basescores of CVEs from the NIST CVE API and display them using go-echarts.
- Technologies used: *Golang, PostgreSQL (Neon), go-echarts*
- Results: See the demo [here](https://github.com/bbjrgithub/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Portfolio/Get_Daily_CVEs#demo).

### [Web Scrapping - Download Newsmax Newsfront](https://github.com/bbjrgithub/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Portfolio/Download_Newsmax_Newsfront)

- Overview: This is a web scrapper that downloads all news articles from the "newfront" archive of www.newsmax.com.
- Technologies used: *Python*
- Results: See the demo [here](https://github.com/bbjrgithub/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Portfolio/Download_Newsmax_Newsfront#demo).

### [Reddit TCM Movies Data Pipeline](https://github.com/bbjrgithub/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Portfolio/Reddit_TCM_Movies_Data_Pipeline)

- Overview: This is a re-implementation of Yusuf Ganiyu's (CodeWithYu) [Reddit Data Pipeline Engineering](https://github.com/airscholar/RedditDataEngineering) project. The pipeline extracts data from the /r/TurnerClassicMovies subreddit and loads it into Redshift.
- Technologies used: *Airflow*, *Docker*, *Python*, *AWS S3 & Redshift*
- Results: See the demo [here](https://github.com/bbjrgithub/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Portfolio/Reddit_TCM_Movies_Data_Pipeline#demo).
