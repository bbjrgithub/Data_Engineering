Hello! This is my in progress Data Engineering portfolio. Most of the projects are being done as part of my self development, covering essentials skills used in the Data Engineering area.

### [Pulling Data From A JSON RESTful API - Get Daily CVEs](https://github.com/bbjrgithub/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Portfolio/Get_Daily_CVEs)

- Overview: For my first Data Engineering project I decided to be contrarian and use Golang instead of the commonly used Python to extract the basescores of CVEs from the NIST CVE API and display them using go-echarts.
- Technologies used: *Golang, PostgreSQL (Neon), go-echarts*
- Results: See the demo [here](https://github.com/bbjrgithub/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Portfolio/Get_Daily_CVEs#demo).
